# Firebase Sandbox: Booky Project ðŸ“š

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--development-yellow)

A simple sandbox project to explore Firebase tools.
Heavily inspired by [Scrimba](scrimba.com)'s *Learn Firebase* course, but with
my own twist!

## To Run the Project ðŸš€

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open the localhost URL (usually
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) with your browser to
see the app.
